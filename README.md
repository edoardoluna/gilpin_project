# KPZ universality class statistics

We numerically investigate the statistical properties of several systems within the KPZ universality class, including growth models in d-dimensions and directed percolation.

We will create a stochastic PDE solver for handling the KPZ equation in d=1,2,3,4, and then proceed to probe the statistical properties of it in a jupyter notebook. The work will be split between the SPDE solver, stochastic simulations of other systems in the universality class, and data analysis.
